Changelog
=========

v0.2.0
------

* Multiple sources now supported. Also PagerDuty. Still very much a WIP, there is a bunch
  of internal refactoring to do, but I *think* the config.yml schema is now pretty solid.

v0.1.0
------

* Initial version, not tagged. This is a POC in stripping the JIRA logic out of
  go-jira-ui and making something more generic. Uchiwa implemented, because it is easy.
* A basic HTTP 'traffic light' dashboard can also be enabled.
